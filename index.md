The following represents the [Molecular Sciences Software Institute]({{ site.molssi_site }})(MolSSI) workshop 
series in heterogeneous parallel programming with CUDA C/C++ at the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels.
To see the full MolSSI's education mission statement, please see [here](http://molssi.org/education/education-mission-statement/).

> ## Prerequisites
>
> - Previous knowledge of High-performance Computing (HPC) basic concepts are helpful but not required for starting this course.
Nevertheless, we encourage students to take a glance at our [Parallel Programming](https://education.molssi.org/parallel-programming)
tutorial, specifically, Chapters 1, 2 and 5 for a brief overview of some of the fundamental concepts in HPC.
> - Basic familiarity with Bash, C and C++ programming languages is required.
